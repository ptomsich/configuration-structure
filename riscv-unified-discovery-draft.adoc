= RISC-V Unified Discovery Specification

== Introduction

Unified Discovery is intended to be a low-level discovery mechanism. A low-level discovery 
mechanism is distinguished from a high-level discovery mechanism. The former typically 
prepare and produce necessary data that is consumed by the latter. Diversified 
applications would require different high-level mechanism, meanwhile, the low-level 
mechanism provides the foundation.

This proposal describes a low-level discovery mechanism that is capable of supporting the 
following use cases:

. Hosted discovery of features by firmware, operating systems and applications
.. Rich operating systems
.. Simple software applications
. Discovery of features by external debug tools
. Out-of-band discovery of features to allow development tools to specialise
. firmware (e.g. choose the appropriate target flags for compilation and link in the 
required libraries) for deeply embedded applications

As an example, consider a typical Linux stack:

. Firmware performs system/machine-dependent discovery and populates either a Linux device 
tree or ACPI tables.
. The Linux kernel parses either a Linux device tree or ACPI tables, exposing system 
specifics to userland processes through multiple interfaces:
.. special files the /proc filesystem
.. device drivers available under /dev
.. files in a mounted sysfs instance
.. flags injected into ELF binaries through the ELF auxiliary vector and accessible 
through getauxval()
.. configuration retrieved through the sysconf() system call
.. information retrievable through the vdso (a virtual DSO mapped by the kernel into each 
processes’ address space)

=== No Central Registry

The proposal provides a solution that does not require a central registry.

RISC-V allows the vendor-specific extensibility of the ISA without any coordination with
RISC-V International (as long as no required features are removed and no incompatible
features are introduced).

This should also be reflected in the architecture of the discovery format and require a
minimum coordination between implementation and RISC-V International:

. Based on the published “rules of the land” (i.e. modelling language, encoding rules and 
the top-level message description), implementers (both soft- and hardware) shall be able 
to:
.. add proprietary entries in the configuration message, that can safely be identified, 
skipped and linked back to the vendor (without a global vendor registry being operated by 
RISC-V) that specified the proprietary entry
.. parse any configuration message, including the ability:
... to parse a newer-version message, identifying the new “extensions” and being able to 
safely skip over them
... To parse a message containing vendor-extensions
. Publish a basic message format that enforces the presence of required fields as a 
machine-readable document/schema.

=== Complete Consumption Requirement

A key requirement in any discovery process that avoids a centralized registry is a 
client’s ability to discover that it has read the entire message (including parts that it 
can not understand and skips over) and whether any unparsable extra elements were included 
in the message. This is termed the Complete Consumption Requirement.

NOTE: The complete consumption requirement is one of the unresolvable issues for 
CPUID-style instructions that query for values using keys.

=== Note on Security

Independent of the underlying mechanism (i.e. whether a memory-based configuration message 
is read or CPUID-style instructions are used), securing the discovery mechanism will 
require cryptographically signed checksums (i.e. electronic signatures) to ascertain the 
authenticity, integrity and the originator of the configuration data.

Signing the configuration message should be an integral (albeit optional) part of the 
message format. While this can not address the playback of a valid configuration message, 
it allows the discovery of modified messages.

We do not believe that the goal of end-to-end security can be efficiently achieved using a 
design-approach similar to Intel’s CPUID instruction: a cryptographic signature would need 
to be computed across the entire configuration space (and not merely individual elements). 
This precludes the absence of a central registry, as the valid key space needs to be known 
in advance to concatenate the plaintext for signing.

== Solution Outline

. Schema + Value Notation (human readable form) + Parser

. Reuse existing standards -> ITU standards & examples (SNMP)

. vendor-specific info

A binary-encoded representation of a device’s configuration is made available to software 
within the device’s physical address space. The data structure is described as a subset of 
ASN.1 (see ITU-T X.680 and ISO/IEC 8824) and encoded using standardized encoding rules 
(see ITU-T X.690 and ISO 8825). For in-memory representations, the unaligned packed 
encoding rules (unaligned PER, see ITU-T X.691) are used. The configuration data can 
(optionally) be cryptographically signed.

NOTE: The data structure is static in the sense that no attempt to dynamically enumerate 
hardware resource is performed. For example, for devices on a hot-pluggable bus such as 
USB, it is up to the subsequent boot sequences, if needed, to enumerate the devices and 
add to the handover structure, such as a device tree, expected by the next boot stage 
after the boot loader.

This proposal provides a schema of the data structure that is generic and extensible. See 
Section 8 for the schema. Vendor-specific data can be included without hindering the 
successful parsing of the configuration.(?)

The base-address of the binary-encoded representation is accessible through a single CSR. 
No other ISA considerations, beyond the provision of an additional CSR, are required.

Target software (usually firmware) that performs discovery will read the uPER-encoded 
message to retrieve the relevant configuration elements. The message can be decoded either 
using a stream parser with small memory footprint (i.e. the parser reads from the 
beginning until it retrieves the requested data element) or can be converted 
start-to-finish into a firmware-specific data structure. Given the compact representation 
and the low memory requirements for parsers, a uPER message can be efficiently parsed even 
during the startup of a deeply embedded microcontroller application (even though we 
envision out-of-band discovery and specialization for deeply embedded and 
resource-constrained use-cases).

The unified discovery mechanism for RISC-V builds on the following technology stack:

. ASN.1 (X.680) for modelling the data structures, independent of their encoding

. Packed Encoding Rules (X.691) for the binary encoding of data structures (in-band)

. XML Encoding Rules (X.693) for the XML encoding of data structures (out-of-band)

. RISC-V International specific guidelines to allow the efficient aggregation of RISC-V 
global and vendor-specific data elements without a central registration authority

. RISC-V International specific guidelines for the encoding of detached signatures 
(PKCS#7/CMS) using Packed Encoding Rules


NOTE: The benefits of using X.680 and X.693 over vendor-specific (e.g., Google Protobuf, 
Apache Avro, ...) marshalling frameworks are its international standardization, widespread 
adoption and availability of open-source and commercial codec libraries.

Retrieval and decoding of the configuration structure can happen in any of the following 
scenarios:

- Software (in-band)

Firmware will access the CSR and read the configuration message to extract the device’s 
configuration as part of its discovery process. The implementation details of this process 
(e.g., whether firmware initiates a read from the top and searches for individual tags, or 
if firmware converts the entire discovery information into an in-memory representation at 
    once) are left to device implementers.

- External debug (in-band)

External debug will retrieve the CSR and then read out (once) the referenced memory region 
to retrieve the configuration information for a specific target device. The retrieved 
configuration message is then parsed by the external debugger to determine the 
configuration, features and capabilities of the device.

- Software development environment (out-of-band)

For (deeply) embedded applications, firmware will be specialised to target the specific 
target device only by pushing the discovery and configuration to the software development 
environment. These cases can be efficiently supported either by reading the configuration 
structure from a target device using an external debugger, or by retrieving a 
configuration structure from the manufacturer’s website.

== The mconfigptr CSR

The machine config pointer (mconfigptr) CSR provides the base-address of the 
binary-encoded representation. The mconfigptr is a machine-mode CSR. On platforms that 
does not require runtime update of the address of the binary representation of the 
configuration, this register can be hardwired to zero.

For backward compatibility, the firmware can emulate this CSR on platforms that does not 
implement this CSR prior to this proposal.

== Hypervisor: Unified Discovery for Guest OSes

For virtualisation purposes, only the retrieval of the mconfigptr CSR has to be 
intercepted (i.e. either a virtualized CSR would be provided to the guest that can be 
written by the hypervisor — or trap-and-emulate would be used) if the guest is to be 
provided with a configuration structure that may or may not be from what is retrieved from 
the underlying hardware.

== Referenced standards

RISC-V Unified Discovery builds on the X.680-X.693 ("Information Technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) & ASN.1 encoding rules" standards-series published by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU):

. X.680: Information technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Specification of basic notation
. X.681: Information technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Information object specification
. X.682: Information technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Constraint specification
. X.683: Information technology - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Parameterization of ASN.1 specifications
. X.690: Information technology - ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
. X.691: Information technology - ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Packed Encoding Rules (PER)

The X.680-X.693 standards are well-established, openly-available standards that are proven building blocks for a wide variety of information technology applications, including X.509 digital certificates, SNMP, LDAP, ISO 7816-4 smartcards, 4G/LTE, and 5G.
